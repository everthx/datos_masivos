# Practice 3

In the present practice, an analysis of the following codes was carried out:

>In this practice the goal was to code in Scala an 
>algorythm to calculare an circle's radius. 
>**Our solution was the following:**
```scala
def listEvens(list:List[Int]): String ={
    for(n <- list){
        if(n%2==0){
            println(s"$n is even")
        }else{
            println(s"$n is odd")
        }
    }
    return "Done"
}
```
