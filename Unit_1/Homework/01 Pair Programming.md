# Pair Programming

>Pair programming requires that 2 programmers participate in a combined effort of development in a worksite.
Each member does an action that the other is not doing at the moment: While one codes the unit tests the other thinks of the implementation to pass the test, for example.

>The person who is coding receives the name of "Controller"  while the other one directing the activity receives the name of "Navigator".
It is suggested that both parties change their roles at least every half an hour or after each unit test.

>This practice has been very well adopted by teams based on Agile workflow but seems this technique has been used well before the Agile movement.

>Something less of a habit is a method denominates as remote pair programming. In this case, programmers don't sit together, they are located in totally different places. 
For this method to work, special technical solutions must be used. Even at a distance, the teammates must have a direct line of communication and be able to access the code and visualize any changes in real-time.

>This ping-pong technique for programming can be used in a pedagogic way on beginners or by experienced programmes in the following way:

>- **Beginner:** It allows them to practice as a navigator and intervene in an appropriate way in the development of software. It allows them to participate as a conductor and explain the code as it is being written.
>- **Intermediate:** It allows them to decide at what moment to change rolls. They know which moment is best to take control of the keyboard again.
>- **Advanced:** It allows them easy integration to what another pair has been working on and take the position of navigator in a more efficient way.
