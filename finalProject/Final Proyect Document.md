# Introduction

<p align="justify" >
This document specifies the analysis and development of the final project of unit 4 of the matter of big data, which the objective of this final project is to compare the Machine Learning performance algorithms that were seen during the semester, which The Bank Marketing data set obtained from the following source will be used:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
The implementation of these algorithms is explained, as well as the result that was reached, through a tabulation to better visualize the performance of each one of them.

# Theoretical framework of algorithms

### SVM

<p align="justify" >
The acronym SVM for its acronym in English (Support Vector Machines). They can be used for both regression and classification. Support vector machines are a machine learning technique that finds the best possible separation between classes. With two dimensions it is easy to understand what you are doing. Typically, machine learning problems have many dimensions. So instead of finding the optimal line, the SVM finds the hyperplane that maximizes the separation margin between classes. [1]
</p>

<p align="justify" >
The support vectors are the points that define the maximum margin of separation of the hyperplane that separates the classes. They are called vectors, instead of points, because these "points" have as many elements as the dimensions of our input space. That is, these multi-dimensional points are represented with an n-dimensional vector. [1]

SVM can be of two types:

- **Linear SVM:** Linear SVM is used for linearly separable data, which means that if a data set can be classified into two classes using a single straight line, then such data is called linearly separable data and the classifier is used as linear SVM classifier. .
- **Non-linear SVM:** Non-linear SVM is used for non-linearly separated data, which means that if a data set cannot be classified by a straight line, then the data is called non-linear data and the classifier used is called non-linear linear SVM classifier. [2]
